# 🧠 **Models for Summarization App** ✨

## **Overview** 🌟

Welcome to the **Summarization App**! 🚀 This project leverages powerful language models to generate concise and coherent text summaries. The primary model used for summarization in this project is **`t5-small`**, a lightweight transformer model from HuggingFace. 

This model is well-suited for natural language processing tasks like **text summarization**, and offers a great balance between performance and resource efficiency.

## **How It Works** 🔍

The **Summarization App** uses models from HuggingFace’s **transformers** library. Fortunately, you don't need to manually download the models—everything is handled automatically when the app runs!

### **Automatic Model Download** 🌐

The backend FastAPI service automatically fetches the necessary model when the app starts. Here's how it works behind the scenes:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the summarization model
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="t5-small", tokenizer="t5-small")
